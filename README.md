## Findings

### Product Category by average discount Percentage

HomeImprovement (57.5%) offers the highest average discount.

Likely a strategic push to drive sales in this category.

- Above-Average Discounts:

Computers & Accessories, Health & PersonalCare, and Electronics are above the overall average (46.64%).

These could be competitive markets where price cuts are used to boost customer acquisition.

- Very Low Discounts:

Office Products (12.35%) and Toys&Games (0.00%) have the lowest discounts.

May indicate premium pricing strategy, less competition, or oversight.

Toys & Games:

Below is the detail findings based on the salesdata provided:

## Conclusions
---
The analysis reveals that discount strategies vary significantly across product categories, with an overall average discount of 46.64%.

- Home Improvement, Computers & Accessories, and Health & PersonalCare receive the highest average discounts, suggesting aggressive promotional tactics to drive volume or compete in saturated markets.

- In contrast, Office Products and Toys & Games have minimal to no discounts, which could indicate premium positioning, low competition, or missed opportunities in pricing strategy.

To maximize performance, the business should reassess low-discount categories, ensure that high discounts align with profit goals, and consider more balanced or dynamic pricing strategies across all product lines.


## Recommendations
---
- Evaluate Pricing for Office Products & Toys & Games:

- Reassess strategy—low/zero discounts may be hurting sales.

- Consider running promotions or bundling offers to attract attention.

- Monitor Profit Margins in High-Discount Categories:

- Home Improvement and Electronics may risk profit loss if margins are thin.

- Ensure discounting is offset by volume or cross-sells.

- Optimize Marketing in High-Discount Areas:

- Highlight discounts in Computers & Accessories and Health & PersonalCare in ads to capitalize on high perceived value.

Diversify Discount Strategies:

- Instead of flat discounts, consider tiered offers or limited-time deals to create urgency without over-discounting.

Review Competitor Pricing:

Particularly in low-discount categories to ensure competitive edge is not been loosed.
